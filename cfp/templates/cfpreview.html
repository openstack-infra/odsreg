<p>This is the session review screen.</p>
<p>Here you can change the status of the session and add a few comments. The following statuses are available:</p>
<p><i>Unreviewed</i>: you haven't had time to look into this one yet</p>
<p><i>Incomplete</i>: you would like to see changes made to this description before making a decision. Add details on the Reviewer's notes textfield: those will be sent to the proposer.</p>
<p><i>Preapproved</i>: proposed session looks good, you'll schedule it. You may still merge it with another session at scheduling time though. Title and description for preapproved sessions are frozen.</p>
<p><i>Rejected</i>: session is not appropriate, off-topic, not applicable to Grizzly, or not a design summit discussion.</p>
